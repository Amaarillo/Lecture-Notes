# Continous X
You do something continously, like integration or delivery to reduce the size of the releases and thus make them more manageble. 


# Continous Integration
Big bang integration is costly, like in waterfall projects, take a lot of times to make every aspect work together and works without bugs. Monte Fowler said that it is really important to give immediate feedback. Thus you integrate as you work, you write something and check towards unit tests so that your code does not brake anything. Extreme programming advocates for integration and testing of code every few hours. Dedicated tesning machines help, you sit down with the test and do not leave untill every test runs. 

Continous integration makes the quality of the software improve, time to market is increased. 

Testing is crucial for continous integrations such that every addition to the product is of high quality

COntinous integration is more about a change in mindset than a change in development as it is more administration.

# Continous Delivery
Continous delivery or deployment means delivering the code to the customers often. There are multiple practices included in this, sucg as automated deploymeny or automated testing, code reviews and so forth.  

# Continous Deployment Cycles

# DevOps
We need good system administrators and people knowlegable in the hardware to be able to deliver continously. Set up cross functional feature teams to work closley to operations to facilitate continous integration. 

The relationship btween devops and continous integration is that devops makes continous integration easier,
