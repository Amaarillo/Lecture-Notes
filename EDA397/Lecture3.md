# Hydrostatic Project model
In this model, duration, cost, defects and incompleteness can be seen as a set of standing "tubes" with water, pressing down the water in one tube, i.e. reducing for example cost, will "press up" the water into another tube, for example cost. 


# Scrum
Scrum is an agile methodology simular to XP. The difference between scrum and XP is that scrum gives
* Commitment
* Courage
* Focus
* Openess
* Respect

Scurm also has a set of pillars. Inspection (stop and review), Adaptation(adapt after reflection), Transparancy(all is visible). 



XP: 
* Communication

* Courage

The one large difference is that XP is more about technical practices whereas Scrum is more of an organizational practice.
