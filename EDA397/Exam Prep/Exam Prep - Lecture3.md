# Values and principles
XP and scrum have different values where XP focuses on communication, simplicity, feedback and courage. Scrum focuses on committment, courage, focus, openess and respect. 

XP also have multible principles whereas scrum have a set of pillars instead. 

Both of the approaches have smaller increments in which the product is incrementally built, called sprints in scrum. 

## Scrum Team
The scrum team consists of 4 roles. these are 
* Product owner: Optimizes the product backlog in terms of business value. Prioritizes etc, helps team to understand the requirements
* Scrum Master: Teaches people about scrum roles, helps with productivity, supports communication
* Development team: Self organizing, cross functional shared responsibility

## Scum Practices
Scrum is split into events, such as daily scrum, sprint planning etc and artefacts such as the backlog and definition of done,. 

# Artefacts

## User Story
A user story is a requested feature by some stakeholder and is such a promise that this feature will be discussed further. They should have an acceptance criteria such that we can get a DoD. User stories should follow INVEST (Independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, testable)


## Plan iteration
Before an iteration begins the team discusses it, perhaps plays some planning poker, calculates velocity select and prioritize the backlog and decide on commitement.
