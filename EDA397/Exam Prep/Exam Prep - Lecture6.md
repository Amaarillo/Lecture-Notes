Today was all about test driven development wich is a practice promoted in XP. This consists of writing a test for a function before actually wrinting the function. Then writing the function, make sure the test pass, refactor test, refactor code and so forth, in essence, putting the test first untill you see a pattern. The idea is to get a general idea of the code and test that. However as agile is somewhat against makign stuff general this follows naturally. 

We can base the test on the acceptance criteria we have.
