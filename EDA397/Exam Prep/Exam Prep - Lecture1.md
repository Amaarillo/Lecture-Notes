---
Agile processes have become increasingly more common in the later years as the projects undertaken have become more complex and much larger in scope, as such a traditional waterfall process have not been very usable. 

# Agile
Agile is a methodology for development that intends to make the process simpler. The methodology have a set of core characteristic that defines values and principles etc. 

## Values 
Agile also have a set of values which are 
1. Redefined roles for developers managers and customers. 
2. No "Big Upfront" steps
3. Iterative development
4. Limited, negotiated functionality
5. Focus on quality, understood as achieved through testing. 

## Principles
The agile principles are many, 12 in fact and gives good guidelines on what is important. These can be split into two categories, organizational and technical. Organizational is more about the workflow whereas technical is more about the technical aspects such as tests. 

## Roles
There are several roles corresponding to the agile framework. These are: 
* Manager: Supporting role
* Product Owner: Defines and maintail project backlog
* Team: Takes over manager responsibility
- Cross-Functional: THe team includes all necessities to deliver features
* Customer: Central in XP. Constant interaction (is replaced by product owner in scrum) 
* Coach: Help the team stick to agile values, practices and principles etc. 

# eXtreme Programming
eXtreme programming (XP), us an approach to deliver software in smaller iterations(increments) instead of delivering huge chunks, does not advocate for a well dfined  process, instead uses practices. 


## Practices
The practices of XP follows: 

### Onsite Customer
Real customer in room, answers priorities for the project. 

### Planning Game
Plan the features for the iterations, approximate time such that the features can be planned into timeslots via their priority. 

### Continous Integration
Integrate the code and test it every few hours

### Simple Design
The right design at any given time, fewest possible classes and methods

### Small releases
Every release should be as small as possible, and contain the most relevant business requirements.

### Metaphor
Describes how the system works easily

### Testing
Automated tests are crucial, every productive method should have a test. 

### Refactoring
Simplify the design, make the program more modular

### Pair Programming
Two people program together, one writes the code and the other one talks

### Collective Code Ownership
Anybody who sees an opportunity to add value to any portion of the code is required to do so at any time.

### Sustainable Pace
Be fresh in the morning, tired in the night, not much overtime 

### Coding Standards
Consistant look in the code.
