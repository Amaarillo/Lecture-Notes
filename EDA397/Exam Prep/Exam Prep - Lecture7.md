The project Backlog contains all the functionality, such as epics and user story that the product stakeholder would like in the project. In a sense the backlog is a promise to discuss something further in the future. 

The tasks on the backlog is prioritized via the product owner. These are to be prioritized by their potential business value to the project such as cost, knowledge aquisition, risk and so forth. 

The items on the backlog should have an acceptance criteria. 

The number of tasks on the backlog can be used to calculate the teams velocity, i.e. how much they manage to complete in the given timeframe(sprint), and is a basis for a burndown chart.
