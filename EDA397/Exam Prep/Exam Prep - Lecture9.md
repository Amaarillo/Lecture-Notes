The basic idea of continous integration is to mimimize the big bang integrations that may lead to  integrationhell. To basically integrate and test often, modern tools allows for doing this every few hours or even minutes, depending on the size of the project.  This probobly reduces bottlenecks in production, or so is the idea at least. There are multible tools to use that makes this easier.

# Continous Delivery
Continous delivery follows the same mindset with the idea that we deliver often to the customer, thus reducing rush for task to be delivered untill the next delivery. THis yields in theory a higher quality. We need some organizational change and to be able to deliver at all which means technical aspects. 

# Continous Deployment
Ability to install value in running system whenever possible'


# Devops
The idea that we should bridge the gap between development and operation to make continous delivery and deployment more streamlined.
