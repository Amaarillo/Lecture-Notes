This was basically a workshow, which I was unable to attend. 

Miniature scrum excercises can contain different attributes. One example is a lego excercise that consists of building different lego pieces for a city in a limited timeframe. This is a nice representation but do not scale very good. 

The learning outcomes of this workshop included.
* Spatial distance hinders communication
* Multimodal communication is a good thing. 
* Communication has limitations and can be very hard. (knowledge sharing, anyone?)
* Feedback is important, to verify that we are making the correct thing. 
* Process improvement is also key
* Feedback minimizes ambiguities.
