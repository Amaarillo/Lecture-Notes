# Agile in a nutshell
Software was originally prone to Loops (Late, Over budget, Over hours, Poor quality), in '68 the term "Software Engineer" was determined at a NATO conference. This was an attempt to include engineering in software creation. However, items such as super comprehensive documentation was prone to slow down the process rendering it inefficient. Agile is a way to try to combat this. 

*Agile is an idea* or rather a compendium of ideas used in several methodologies such as XP Scrum Kanban etc. The core characteristics are defined by
* Values: General assumptions
* Principles: General Rules 
* Roles: Responsibilites and privelages
* Practices: Specific activities
* Artifacts: Tools included

# Agile Values
The agile values are defined as 'X over Y' meaning X is more important than Y in the methodology. This include
* Individuals and Interaction over Processes and Tools
* Working Software over Comprehensive documentation
* Customer Collaboration over Contract negotiation
* Responding to change over Following a plan

Agile is also a iterative process that focuses on quality as defined by tests.


# Principles
The principles of agile are many and include both organizational and technical aspects. Examples include
Put the customer in the center, Let the team self-organize (organizational)
Develop Iteratively, Treat tests as a key resource (technical)

# Xtreme Programming 
Xtreme programming is a methodoloogy that uses the agile approach. It focuses on the developer. Its built on delivering very small improvements iteratively. The development cycles are 4-6 weeks. It uses several processes. 

## ON site customer
A customer representation that can answer quesitons about the desired outcome of the project, maybe regarding business requirements and such. 

## Planning game
Similar to poker (planning poker yo) that allows developers to estimate the length of doing various tasks and then discuss and prioritize these on difficulty/completion time.

## Continious Integration
INtegrate and test code every few hours. 

## Simple Design
The right design at any given time. 

## Small Releases
Every release should be as small as possible and include the most important business requirmeents.

## Metaphor
Metaphors to better understand how the whole system works

## Testing
Testing should be automated, write tests for every productive method that can break.

## Refactoring
Change the program for ease of modificability

## Pair Programming
Program together good for when exploring new territory. 

## Collective Code ownership
Anyone who sees the opportunity to make the code better should do this at any given moment. 

## Sustainable pace
40h week. Don't break your developers, they are expensive. 

## Coding standards 
Code should be consistant

# Further information
Agile reject big upfront anything, for example requirments documents as it is hardly ever possivble to know in the beginning of a project all requirements.
