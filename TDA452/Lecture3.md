## Working with lists

## What Is a list?
  -A list contains zero or several values that all have the same type. Order in list matters.

In haskell the syntax for a list is:

```haskell
  5 : ( 6 : (3 : [])) == 5 : 6 : 3 : [] == [5,6,3]
  "Haskell" == ['H','a','s','k','e','l','l']
    type String = [Char]
```
