# TDA593 Model-Driven Software Development
## Lecture 3 -
After this lecture we should be able to argument what software archetecture is. Define main characteristics, describe components surrounding this. And also construct component diagrams.

### What is software archetecture?
Software is very different from physical things. Rules that may apply to the "real" object may not apply to the model in the software. Software archetecture is about the same as "real" archetecture, it is the blueprints and such for software that is going to be built.

* Every application has an archetecture.
  - the archetecture can be catagorized by the design desicions during the development
* Every application has at least one archetecture
  - It may, however, have a different name and is therefor not recognized as a archetecture.
* However, archetecture is NOT a phase of development.

The general workflow is that you combine ideas, constraints, requirements and stakeholders interest into a software and stuff.


Software archetecture has some characteristics
  * Multitude of stakeholders
  * Separation of Concerns
  * Quality Driven
  * Reacuirring styles
  * Conceptual integrity

*The explaination for each of theese can be found in the slides.*

The benifits of software archetecture is that it gives a basis for a analysis before the development is started, gives a basis for reuse of elements, gives support for early design choices and facilitates communication to the stakeholders that contributes to the system that fulfill their needs.




Models can be used for early simulation
  * MIL = Models in the loop test with the model in a modeled enviroment
  * SIL = Software in the loop, replace the model with actual code, run in modeled enviroment, verify same behavior
  * HIL = hardware in the loop, Integrate the code in the real ECU

One example of this is Volvo. THey have a lot of software in their cars.

# What formalism to describe the system archetecture  
  * UML/ UML profile
  * archetecture description language (ADL) such as acme and stuff
  *
