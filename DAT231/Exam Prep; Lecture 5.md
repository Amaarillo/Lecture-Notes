Quality Requirements
Summary:

---
QUality requirements specify how efficient and "good" the system shall perform it' tasks. Ususally functional and quality requirements are tightly coupled. 
Quality Requiremennts also can limit one another, for example, higher performance -> lower maintainability. 
The principle ideas is also to make the quality requirements measurable and thus verifiable.
For each Quality requirement we have the following.
* Characteristic: What characteristic the quality requirement have, like Efficiency
* Sub characteristic: What sub characteristic the quality requirement has, for example consumption for a car
* Attribute: What attributes are measured for the sub characteristic, for example fuel and oil consumption
* Metric: How one intends to measure the attribute.

In order to specify what is important to the project one can use a quality grid specifying what is important/ less important and so forth.

### Open Metric: 
Leave it to the supplier to specify the metric.
### PErformance Requirements: 
Response time and so forth
### Usability
How useful the system is to the user, detect through usability tests like heuristic evaluation.
### Usability Reqs
Specify req to specify usability, at most one novice shall encounter critical problems and so forth
### Security
Protect against abuse, reduce threats
### Maintenence 
How mainained the system shall be, the supplier shall fix x withinf y hours
