It's important to validate the requirements in order to make sure that the project does not fail. And to determine that the requirements actually should be built, i.e. they fulfill the customers needs.

Validation means if the requirements fulfill the stakeholders needs. Where as verification means whether the system was implemented according to the requirements (I.E."are we building the system right? ")
