### Validation

---
Requirements Validation is the process to validate whether the requirements fulfills all the stakeholders' wishes.
Further, all the software specification needs to be understood correctly, otherwise it might not be able to validate that it is complete.

Verification is rather about if we are building the system correctly, i.e. all the requirements are present.

There are some various ways one can conduct the validation:
### Inspections
A systematic approach for validation in which different roles (moderator etc.) reads through the document, vary heavyweight.

Can be done by several Tools_

* Checklists: Checking whether the contents on the checklist is in the specification.
* Ad-hoc: No strict guidelines
* Perspective Based Reading: Read the SRS from a specific perspective.

### Tests
This technique is based on manual simulation based on uce cases /tasks etc. via paper prototypes/simulations etc.

* Usability Test: Heuristic evaluation ish
* Prototypes: Do formal or paper prototypes
* Simulation: Simulated program.

OR by mathematical Proofs.

WHen valiating we want to make sure that the SRS fulfills the seven variants of a good requirements specification, these are.
* Correct: Each requirement reflect a stakeholder need or expectation.
* Complete: THe documents reflect all the stakeholders needs, i.e. nothing is "Missing". However many requirements are so trivial that it would be crazy to include these , so all non-trivial reqs should be present.
* Unambigous: All parties agree on what each requirement means
* Consistent: All parts match, for example the E/R diagram and Event list.
* Reanked for importance and stability. PRioritization and expected changes per requirement.
* Modifyable: Easy to change while maintaining consistancy
* Verifyable, should be veryfiable that all requirements are met
* Traceable, to goals/puropose or design/code
