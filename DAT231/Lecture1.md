## What is Software Engineering?
50 years ago we were unable to create high quality software in sufficient time. So experts came together and started developing methodology in development of high quality software.

## Requirements Engineering
In Requirements engineering we focus on breaking down problems into requirements

As such, requirements engineering is a way to systimatically reduce the liklyhood to develop the wrong product.

One of the goals is that no one should change the requirements once they have been set.
The top reasons that SW projects fails are that the requirements are lacking. The requirements should be well defined so that the product are satisfactory and that there is a lack of asssumptions that were not followed.
