## Prototypes
Prototypes is a good way to document and get feedback from your stakeholders. When constructing the prototype one needs a goal, what does a prototype contribute to your project?

A prototype can either be a explorative, experimental or evolotionary prototype, the first one is used to identify prototype, the second to asses technical alternatives and the third one for testing whether it fits the system without changing requirements.

### Tasks
Good tasks should be closed so that they can be reached, should also be small.


## Non Functional Requirements
Usually Runctional and Quality requirements are tightly coupled, for example, having a log in function does not nessecarly make your product safe. Ususally the system attributes together with the constraints are called non-functional requirements.

Quality parameters are ususally a tradeoff, for example; more secure (like 2-factor authentication) = less usable.

When defining quality we define the most important qualities, as it is easier to reach a few well defined qualities than to adhere to the inimportant ones. It is also cheaper.

WE ususally define a quality model consisting of CHaracteristics | Sub- characteristics | Attributes | Metrics, that are abstract in that order (Characteristics being the highest) -> Metrics are measurable. However, when specifying mesuarable metrics, one needs to be wary about "magical numbers" as the may cost a company large amounts of money. When unsure, the number can be blank and be specified later.
