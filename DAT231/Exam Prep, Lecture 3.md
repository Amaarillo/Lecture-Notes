 Summary: This lecture is all about Elicitation and Creativity.

Requirements Engineers must invent, stakeholders are ususally lacking in the knowledge of the technical aspects of the project. For example, Henry Fort created a car when people probably wanted faster horses.

There are multible different stratergies to elicit ideas and be creative, examples include Brainstorming,  THinking aloud,  Hall of Fame,  Constraint Removal etc

 ## Keywords:
 	* Divergant Thinking = Generate ideas through exploration of different alternatives/possibilities. A method fo this is Brainstorming sessions.
 	* Convergant Thinking = Selecting the "correct" ideas from many alternatives.
 	* Incubation - Relaxation period in which people create ideas that denies linear thought.
 	* Illimunation - Shorter period of times when ideas emerge, "HEUREKA" - moments.
 	* Constraint Removal: Group generate ideas based on removing contrainsts untill there are none left.

The paper kinda reflected this, was more of an explanation of a conducted study and was thus not very helpful...
