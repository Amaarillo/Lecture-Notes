### Market driven RE
---

Market driven requirements engineering is when you develop a system that is intendet to be sold on a market, thus the customers may not be well defined, and elicitation must depend on market research. For this developers also have to calculation on time to market, ususally the application in split into releases, that is different versions, each one building on the previous.

There are some challenges in MDRE, such as managing market pull / technology push and that there is a chasm between development and market.

In Decition outcome review we validate whether the previous release had the approriate selection of features, giving us a indication of both the product and decition quality.


### Requirements Prioritization
Is needed to split the application into different releases, thus going hand-in-hand with MDRE. When performing prioritization we need a criteria, for example customer value, business value etc..

When to prioritize, 
In the beginning, On big changes, iteratively.

THere are several scales we can use in prioritization, categorization (numerical assignment), ordinal(Priority grouping, 1-4 (not interval)), ratio(100$)

AHP, comparing al against one another, complex as fuck.

### Release Planning
The goal is to find a set of optimal features to release for each iteration, seen by customer and business value. Thus a release plan should provide the best possible set of features per each release seen by business value.

ONe can use algorithms to create relese plans, however greedy algorigthms are not very good. Further one needs to keep dependencies in mind, features dependant on one another needs to be released jointly.
