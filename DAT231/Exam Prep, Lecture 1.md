# Lecture 1 
Summary: 

## Keywords & explanaitions:
 * Requirements Engineering: This means Eliciting, prioritizing checking and validating requirements in different customer projects, both in bespoke (customer) and market driven devlopment. A systematic likleyhood to reduce the likleyhood to develop a wrong solution.

 * Problem: A problem is a difference of things as required versus things as percieved.

 * Requiremen: A condition needed  by a user to solve a problem/task 

 * Top factors for project failure
 	* Insufficient feedback/ inclompletwe req. specs / change of reqs
 * Top factors for project success
 	* USers are involved/ clearly defined reqs, ealistic expectations

 ## Learning objectives, 
 Backa tillbaks till dette efter exam prep.

 ## Requirements Engineering activities

 ### Elicitation
 Identify stakeholders, elicit requirements , goal analysis etc. 

 ### Interpretation
Indentify requirements / structure/ define/ make concrete

### Negotiation 
Identify dependencies/ identify solve inconsistencies / prioritize

### Documentation
Document requirements, current state / create baseline / Administative attributes

### V & V 
Verify that the requirements correct, and correct requirements 
 * Validation is that a customer can look at a requirement and specify that that is what the customer is requesting
 * Verification is that the product satisfies the requirement. 

 ## Reqs. management 
 ### Change management 
 Manage Change requests, manage versions, Propagate changes 

 ### Tracing 
Within requirements , pre & post - tracing
 * Forward Tracing: tracing from requirements to program to see that all reqs are dealt with / tracing from demands to reqs to see that all the customer wishes are present in the requirements. 
 * Backwards tracing: Tracing from requirements to demands to see that all requirements have a demand. / Tracing from progra m to req, to see that all features in programs correspond to a requirement. 

## Project types & Contexts
 * Inhouse
 The product is developed by the same company that will use it, for example by different departments. Often in larger companies.

 * Product Development
 Product is a commefrcial product merketed by a company, the development is carried out within the company and the customer is the marketing department. Developers never see the customers and have to rely on the marketing dept. 

 * Time & Materials  based development
 A company develops a product for a customer, in iterations, for example month per month and the customer pays the cost, thus the product grows over time, might however cause the cost to skyrocket. 

 * Commercial off- the shelf (COTS)
 A product you can buy, for example Microsoft Office, these might be configured to the customer needs by the customers, so the developers only recommends a COTS system.

 * Customization
 Same as above, however we customize the COTS system to the customer wishes.

 * Tender
 A company sends out a project proposal, contractors create elaborate requirements specification, and the customer selects the one that is the best. 

 * Contract Development
 A supplier develops or customizes a system to a customer and later delivers this system.

 * Sub- contracting
 Sub contractor delivers modules to the main contractor.

 * Unknown (pre-study)
 No idea what the customer wants, needs to clarify the type of REQ. maybe by high level requirements 

 * Hybrid
 Mix of several. 



 ## Contents of specification

 ## Data requirement.
 What data should the system input and output, can be shown in several fashions, ER diagrams, data dictionary etc. 

 ## Functional Requirements
 WHat functions should the system have, Can be specified somewhat in mnany fashions 

 ## Quality requirement
 What quality attributes should the system uphold? Performance, Usability and Maintenence.

 ## Domains 
 THe produvt have different domains

 ## Outer domain
 The people that will interact with the system from the outside, repair staff and so on

 ## Inner domain
 Direct users of the application.

## Goal design level
 A requirement should specify what a system shoud do without specifying how. 

 ### GOal level
  High avbstract level

 ### Domain level 
	Specifies the different tasks related to the req.
### Product Level. 
	Functional, what goes in and out of the product. 

### Design levelÂ¨
	Specifies the interfaces in detail.
