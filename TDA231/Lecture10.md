If we have the original clustering problem we can relax the constraints such that z can be between 0 and 1 instead of having one specific value. 

# Mixture models
Mixture models are a mixture of K probability densities. These consists of component distributions and mixing coefficiants that determines the probability of each componennt. One example of these are the Gaussian mixture model GMM that uses gaussians as the component distributions.
