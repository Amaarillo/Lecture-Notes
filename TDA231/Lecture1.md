AI is growing as a field and is now common in many applications. WE have different paradigms of AI; gen 1 = preprogrammed behaviour, Gen2 = statistical modeling; gen 3 = Deep learning. Deap learning takes a training set from the open/front end layer, do computations in other layers such as feature recognition and present it in the final, also public layer.

THis can also be seen as a cake with reinforcement learning (cherry on top), the icing on the cake (supervised learning) and the cake itself (unsupervised learning.) 

The supervised learning aims to learn algorithms via interaction, requires large amounts of training data.

Unsupervised learning consists of learning different senses of word without training data.

Alan turing gave five different ideas for machine learning; 
1) The turing machine
2) Cryptagraphy
3) THe deterministic computer
4) Thinking machines (AI)
5) System Biology

# Supervised Learning
Supervised learnign has corresponding entities
* Attributes: Input to the model
* Model: the function that converts attributes to a target
* Target: the output of a model
* Data: Attribute response tuples
* Training data: Used to create the model, 

* linear models: a example of a model
* Parameters: used in the linear model
* Loss: Residuals
* Squared loss: e^2
* Average loss: SSQ, we wish to minimize this
