AI have been intresting since the early 90th, some assumed that it would become the next electricity. During the 90th it moved into statistical learning and interference, 

# Supervised learning
Supervised learning is learning when you have some data and a problem and wish to build a model to exmplain the data and eventually be able to make predictions. IN supervised learning we have a set od attributes and corresponding targets (in contrary to unsupervised where we do not have any targets). The linear model can be written as w_0 + w_1x = f(x; w_0,w_1). We can calculate the loss as t_n - f(x;w_0.w_1) i.e. the error of the reak vakue. t_n being the true value. The squared loss is good. Sum all up and divide by number of points is nice. We want to find the minimal loss, so it becomes a optimization problem.
