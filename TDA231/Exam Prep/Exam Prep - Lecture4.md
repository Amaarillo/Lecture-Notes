The gaussian, or normal distibution are widely used in machine learning. We can have multidimensional gaussians which are just the product of all the one dimentional.

This can also be used in various application, comparing models can be done via bayes factors. 

# Classification, Bayes and Naive bayes
Classifications consist of taking some data and classify in based on what label the data most likely corresponds to,. The classifiers can be hard (either 0 or 1) or probability (probability of belonging to a specific class)

# Bayes Classifier
THe bayes classifier is one case of a classifier and consists of selecting a prior and a likelihood for the data to create a posterior distribution. 


# Naive Bayes
The naive bayes classifier follows the same classification but makes the assumption that the likelihood is the same for all classes.
