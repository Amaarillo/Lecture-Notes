It is very tedious to find and reive the loss once we have more parameters that one or two, it is then better to use a vector notation. 

The vector notation allows us to have higher order functions by creating a X vector with ones and the order number of rows and columns. We can also use whatever functions h(x) we please. 


We can use some of the data to train the weights, i.e. model and validate on the rest odf the data, might be good to randomize the data. Splitting into K sets and training on 9, validating on 1 for every permutation is called K-fold cross validation.
