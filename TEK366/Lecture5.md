## Functional, project and matrix. 
In the functional organization, we are woring in a "Silo", that is, different departments such as HR, finance etc. THe challenge here is the cross-functional work. If not used to working in this fashion, creating the confidence to work in the cross functional teams is important. Team building is important.

In the project organization the companies conduct lots of projects simontainiously, thus communication between the different projects is important. The challenge with these kind of structure is the learning, we tend not to "learn" from the project, we just move onto the next project.

The matrix organization is an organization that ususally work in both projects and not in projects. That is one ususally have two bosses, which a worker needs to keep satisfied. The bosses can, for example, be an organisational boss and a project leader. 

## Teamwork
Forming a team, that is, going from having a group into becoming a team can be challenging. THe teamwork can be split into several phases
* Collection phase: Fairly polite, do not always say what we want as we do not know the people. We don't want conflicts. As such, the effectivness is not very high. Team building is important to get quickly to this phase.
* Entrenchment Phase: We have the answers to the question what the assignemnt is about. WE also know the people and what they want to do/contribute. Here, power structures occur. Effectivness not very high, given all conflicts.
* Resolution/ accomondation - Phase: This is where the bulk of the work takes place. This is efficient and the efficiency increases over time. Because the team have overcome conflicts.
* Synergy phase: High efficiency, but stabalizing.
* Decline phase: THis is the "end" of the project where the team have "moved on" to the next project, thus the efficiency declines. 
Project leaders want to make the Collection, Entrenchment and Decline phases as short as possible.

## Team Roles.
How is it, that one can have two teams that look the same in regards of experience, age, gender etc. but one team is performing really well, and the other team is struggling. THe Swedish word for not being able to work with one another is "Personkemi", personal chemistry. We are either attracting one another or rejecting one another. It's a bad excuse, we can still do something about this. 

We as people contains of several "Layers" that contribute to well we can work with other people. THe mopst basic is DNA, or genetic code. THis cannot change. 
THe second layer is the personality, this is created by our genetic code and enviroment during upbringing. THis cannot be changed either.
THe third layer is the "role layer", this can be changed. We have different roles at different places. For exmaple, we have different roles in projects versus with friends and family. But we do not have one definite role, we have role preferences, these can be manipulated as we might be more confortable in specific roles, but we can still take on other roles in projects. 

The different typical roles are 
* Plants: Come up with the bulk of the ideas. The ideas may not be feasable, but they are very creative.
* Resource Investigator: This role will usually conist of a person investigating and finding the resource. But are not interested in following up on the work, only likes to connect things. 
* Coordinator: THe "Coach" for the team, the person who sees the strength and weaknesses of the team and can deligate the work. All managers want to be coordinators but very few are. 
* SHaper: THe chaper likes to "win". Thus the shaper has the tendency to push people to hard and "hurt people". Usually unkowingly. The shaper can burn out people. 
* Monitor Evaluator: This role is usually good at finding flaws in a plan. Kinda good at finding flaws. If they say that "This might succeed", its a good sign. They can however, be overly critizising.
* Teamworker: The swedish teamworker introduces people to "Fika". Also brings cake. THe teamworker likes to make people happy and feel "at home" in the group. However, when we don't get along in the group, the teamworker is not comfortable. 
* Implementer: THe strength of the implementer is putting plans into action, by working exactly as specified in the plan. We can always trust the implementor to deliver according to plan, but not change the plan or deliver something not specified in the plan. Thus the implementor does not have their strengths in the planning. 
* Completer Finisher: Strength in delivery but also have a high level of detail in solutions, "Good enough" is nos acceptable, will not deliver anyithing that is not "100% quality". 
* Specialist: Not really a team role. THe typical specialist does not want to be in a team, very good in a very narrow area. THey like to be in theior comfort zone. 

A high performing team is a team that consist of several different roles. This team needs longer time to adjust.  but once the collection/entrenchment phases are done they are very efficient. A team with simular roles will get into work faster, but will not deliver as good products as they are not really challenges. 


## What is management and leading
People like Donald Trump likes to think of themself as "Natural Born Leaders". This is not true, they can be taught and learned, if the subject wants to learn. However, other contributing factors such as intelligence cannot be taught, but are usually not very contributing in what makes a person a good leader. 

Maylor discusses the importance of time management for leaders. Proactive time management, such as looking what can harm us is ususally important to spend time on. Also Reactive, for example putting out fires. And inactive time, that is, the importance of resting.
