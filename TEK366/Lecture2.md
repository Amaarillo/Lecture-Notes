A stage gate is a very high level plan. Might be good to set up in the initial phases of the project. Splits the project into phases. And lays criteria for passing into the next phase of the project. This is good, because if a customer want to do a change you can "Back up" for a cost that the customer will have to pay. But in order to get them to pay GET IT IN WRITING that you've passed the gate. 

We can think of the project as people looking through keyholes, each person can see the project in a different way.

A work breakdown structure resides around breaking the project down into several smaller chunks.

Splittign the project we initially have the feasability study. IS the project feasable? Spending time here reduces the learning curve. For example, the first looks at the Ã–resundsbro was done 100 years before the build start. 

Look into the (activity)network plan/ Node network in the book. Will probobly appear on the dugga. We always should have a start and an end node in these, no loose ends.

### Gantt chart
PROS: Easy to communicate and construct and understood. etc.
CONS: Does not help in optimizing resource allocation, this will have do be done manually.

### Time estimation.
We ususally take more time than the ideal as we have interruptions, learning curves for multitasking etc. We like the system one system (easily accessable knowledge). 

Controlling communication is vital
X = N(N-1)/2 is the number of communication path for a team of N people
