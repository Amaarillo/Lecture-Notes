This course mainly focuses on a few topics surrounding project management, like organizing and psychology. The work is split into three parts, the exam for the book, four cases that should be done in a group and the lecture series, a home exam.   

According to Kahneman, we don't know how we do things, like multiplying 5*6, we just do it. However, harder things to calculate are, well harder. Ususally we are not motivated to do this. The quick and easy tasks are called system one, the difficult ones are called system 2. 

Sometimes we can do skillfull things, without knowing that we don't know how we do them.

Hellin aims to go through the book, however, he has some slides of his own.

A good question in project management is "WHy," why are we doing this?  

A few basic definition for a project are 
* Unique: The project is unique otherwise one can replicate a previous.
* Temporary: The project has a beginning and an end.
* Focused: the project is delivering one or two defined deliverable (product or service)
* Emergence: 
* Uncertainty: We might not be certaion in the initial phase of the project. We need to learn as we go on.
* Integration: The project does not run in an isolatet enviroment. The project influence other projects.
* Social Construction: There is people involved and people dont work as machines, management skills are emportant.
* Change: A project always delivers change (since the project delivers something new). "Everybody likes change but not to change."

# Project Models
Project models are used to "make sense" of the project. An example of this is the PASTEL model. This specifies what lies outside of the inner sphere of the porject, for example politics and economics. The *internal complexity* is a model specifying internal characteristics, for example stratergies, staff, culture, stakeholders etc. 

### The iron triangle (Managing strategic choices)
This states that one needs to select two of the three edges and the other one needs to be negotiable. Otherwise we fall into "The zone of no brain".
