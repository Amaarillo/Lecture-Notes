# Case Study Research 
Case study research consists of conducting a case study for research purposes, this is very much applicable in the field of software engineering. A case study consists of "investigate contemporary phenomenon in their natural context", thus no set up of a study enviroment in an laboratory is used as it may influence the results. The goal is to pose as little as possible effect on the natural flow of a phenomenon, for example in a company. 

A case study is split into and iterated over several phases that fall naturally after one another. 

There are three different research methodologies that are usually related to a case study: 
* Survey - Collection of standardized information from a population
* Experiment - Measuring the effect of controlling one variable on another variable.
* Action Research - Change some aspect of the focus of the research. See outcomes.

Different research methodologies have different purposes, depends on what we want to acomplish: 
* Exploratory - Find out what is happening and find new ideas and hypothesis for research. 
* Descriptive - Potray something 
* Explanatory - Seek explanation for something
* Improving - Improving apon something


The *Case* under investigation in a case study can be multiple things such as; an organisation, a person  an artefact etc. 
Ususally a case study can be used to understand, explain, interprete etc. Thus it can be very broad. 

Case studies can have two different timeframes 
* Retrospective - Select on dependant variable and compress time 
* Longitudinal - No "survival bias", mesure the effect of designed interventions

Triangulation can be used to determine what to be used, for example for >40 participants, a survey is suitable, for 10-40 a semi structured review can be used, etc.
