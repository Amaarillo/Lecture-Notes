## Survey Research

Survey research is a research methodology that is common in the masters thesis. However, we should not only use a survey, not enough innovative height, as we should prove that we can use several research methodologies Conducting a survey is just as difficult as any other research method.  

Kitchenham have very good guidelines on conducting surveys. 

### How do we pick a good sample
Not always possible to draw randomly from the population, stratefied sampling is good. 
THis means that we would like to pick for example software engineering students from different schools, for example from the top three educations. Maybe we do not have access to the other schools, but only Chalmers students. Then we can use them but we do a 'convinience sampling' and can as such not make general assumptions about the population. However, from a scientific point of view, this is not good as it does not allow to further the sience given that we cannot make general assumptions.

## Types
* Longitudinal: Collect data at different points of time. 


### Identify Sampling
* SImple Random sampling
* Stratified random - pick 10 males and 10 females for example

* Convinience Sampling - It is convenient and easy, man have large threats to validity.

Random.org listens to the background noice, use this for randomness yo

Depending on our sample size we will be able to see effects. If we have a big sample size we can find large effects, in small we cannot. 

We should not use open ended question in the end since the respondants are the most tired there.
