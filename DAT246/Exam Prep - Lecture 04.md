## Experimental Design I 
We as humans tend to add additional information to different situations based on our previous experiences and such, thus we ca nget an incorrect answer to a question because our brain wants the question to be easy, basing it on previous experiences. Once we realize our intuition is wrong, me might become confused. As such, lots of information can be different depending on the point of view for an observer, everything is relative. As such, we need a good approach to be able to "prove" something from a scientific standpoint. We need experimental design .

# Experimental Design 
An experiment usually starts with an hypothesis(conjecture) after this we design the experiment I.E. what is to be done, then we conduct the experiment and analyze it. This will usually lead to new hypothesises and we start over again. From this "circle" we get an amound of knowledge. 

Every operation in an experiment consists of the response and some sort of error. I.e. we alsways have somewhat of an residual or error. 

Standard research methods can be the following: 

### Descriptive
We are focused on describing the world oround us. Such as case studies, obeservations, Surveys and interviews 

### Correlational 
See whether two things are related to one another, ie are correlated. Are the relationships positive or negative and the strength between the artefacts. 

### Experimental 
Cause and effect, manipulating one variable (the others are held constant) and see the response vary 


Ususally these methods fall after one another, Descriptive -> Correlational -> Experimental
I.e. we describe and come up with a hypothesis -> see if the hypothesis is valid, or correlated -> Try to explain and get a better foundation for understanding.

However, it is important to note that correlation does not cause causation. 


## Experimental Lingo
It is important to get a basic vocabulary so that we can get a standard in the way we talk about experiments.

### Control
Control is the set of standard values for which we compare against
### Replication 
We need to be able to do and/or repeate the ecperiment multiple times

### Randomization 
Bias is bad, we assignt treatments randomly to subjects

### Observational Study
Observe without any treatment

### Experiment
Actively making difference in the enviroment, i.e. changing a variable.

### Experimental Unit
The unit in which the experiment is run opon, for example the subject in a medical study 

### Factor/Explanatory Variable
The variable we will look at, i.e. what we will change, for example programming language

### Level
THe degree of change in the factor, example different programming languages

### Response Variable
What we are measuring

### Treatment 
A factor and a level, a specific both.

### Experimental Object 
The same thing as experimental unit ie the object under study. i.e. programming language

### Experimental Subject
THe person applying the object 

### Parameters
We know these can vary but we dont want to, we want to control them
### BLocking variables
Same as parameter but will vary over time. For example the experience of testers

### Interactions
The factors can interact with one another

### Unitary Experiment 
One experimental run

### Internal /External replication
Internal = Same experimenters do the experiment, External = other experimenters

### Errors (random and systematic)
Random errors = Random, we cannot do anything
Systematic = The error is common and we can fix this

When we have multiple levels and facors we need to do a full factorial design to be able to distinguish all the interaction effects. Howeverm this is often not feasable and thus we cna do a fractional factorial design, i.e. skip some treatments
