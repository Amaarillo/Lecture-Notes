# Systematic Litterature Reviews
Evidence based research in medicine have changed several fields of research, given that failure to synthesise medicine research can result in patient deaths. A systematic litterature review aims to overlook and analyze current research in a specific topic to find flaws and missing part of the total picture. It is a well defined process which provides the gaps that exist in the topic and suggests framework to position new research to combat the loss of knowledge. 

As such, SLR gives a good indication of the current state of research. There are several different ways to structure a SLR

* Standard SLR: Answer specific research questions

* Mapping Study: Classify all the litterature in a given field of study.

* Tertiary Study: A SLR in which the main studies are SLR (yo dawg, I heard you like SLR so I put an SLR in your SLR)


## Process
The standard way of constructing a SLR can be split into three different steps
### Plan Review
Specify the research questions, Develop the research protocol, Validate Review Protocol. As such, the related task required to structure the review

The research questions determines relevant primary studies by "defining" search strings which one can search databases for.  Not as important for mapping stidues. 

When developing the research protocal the researcher can get methods for selecting work, redicing the chance of researcher selecting papers to fulfill own intuition (confirmation bias). The protocol should contain background, research questions, stratergy for selecting primary studies and procedure for screening these studies. As well as quality assesment process, Data extraction process and procedure for data analysis.

### Conduct the review
Identify relevant research, Select primary studies, Asses study quality, Extract Required Data, Synthesize data. I.e conduct the study by finding relevant research, selecting the most suitable with sufficient quality and extract and synthesize data.

### Document Review
Write Review Report, Validate report. i.e. document that shit. 


## Why conduct SLR's?
The disadvantages are that the work is often exhaustive and takes more time than "regular" studies, can also be difficult for lone researchers. However, gives a very structured way of reviewing the work currently being conducted within a specific topic. They are also good as they can contradict "common knowledge" and give a much better insight into a topic than "expert opinions".
