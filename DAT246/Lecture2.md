### What is a case? 
A case can be several different entities, for example; a person, a site/organization, artefact(technology, project etc, not very common for thesises) etc. When conducting the case study we have a unit of analysis such as events and activities.

> The idea of a case study is to investigate one thing in one place. We should do the study in the real life enviroment, to avoid manipulating this.

Case studies can have different types, such as illustrative, explotatory etc.

* Exploratory: You want to do the case study to generate research questions, we don't know so much.
* Cumulative; We conduct several case studies to accumalate studies over time
* Critical instance case studies: We investigate only one extreme case, an outlier.

### Why should we use this? 
Case studies are about the context. The context determines what the case study will contain. Solving problems in software development organization is a usage of the case study. Case studies can yield
* 1: Motivation of research
* 2: Inspiration for new ideas
* 3: Illustration, we can find factors for different cases.


Case studies are a bit frowned upon, our interpretation of a case study is not the same as for example a physicists case study.

>In case studies, we have a small sample but a lot of variables. 

The exploratory part of a case study can contain the research method "grounded theory", this is a way of labling qualitative data to generate knowledge. This is hard. Maybe not suitable for a masters thesis.

Another part is the theory part. Here we can test a theory to see if it applies

The final part is the problem solving part. Finding a problem, observing and solving the problem.

### Misunderstandings
Case study research can be misunderstood. For example, case study research does not contribute to scientific development. Important to adhere to these misunderstandings to create a correct case study.

### Designing the case study
How many cases should we have? Usually 4 and 10 units are a good measurment for a case study.
Selecting a sample size for the case study can be hard, usually it varies depending on what type we want to conduct. For example, in semi-structured interviews, 10-40 might be a good guideline.
