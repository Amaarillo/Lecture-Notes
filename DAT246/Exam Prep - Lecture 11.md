# Validity Threats
Validity threats are important as it is good to overview what may potentially harm a study before conducting it as it might be difficult to redo it. There are several different types of validity threats one can think of. 

### Conclusion Validity 
Are we able to make correct conclusions between treatment and outcome and are there any statistical corrfelation between these. Things that may influence the conclusion validity includes: 
* Low statistical power
* Violated assumptions of statistical tests (for example, independance of residuals)
* Fishing and the error rate.
* Reliability of measures
* Reliability of treatment implementation
* Random irrelevances in experimanetal setting
* Random hetrogenity of subjects 


### Internal Validity 
Can something outside our control cause the same effect. Things that may influence this are 
* Single group threats such as Selection, Mortality, Maturation etc
* Multiple group threats - interaction effects between single group threats

### Construct Validity 
Are we measuring the correct thing and does our treatment reflect the cause construct? Things that may influence this are: 
* Design Threats. Have we made errors in the design of our treatments? sucha as Mono-method bias etc

### External Validity 
Can we generalize our findings and are our cause-effect construct context dependant. Things that may influence this are: 
* Social threats such as hypothesis guessing
* interaction of setting and treatment

The difficulty with validity threats are that attempts of minimizing one of the types may increase another type, example: 
"More homogenous subjects may increase conclusion validity but decrease external validity."


Different types of research approaches have different priorities.

### Theory testing
* Internal Validity 
* Construct Validity
* Conclusion Validity

### Applied Research 
* Internal Validity
* External Validity
* Construct Validity

### Case Studies
* Social Threats
* Conclusion Validity
* Internal Validity
* External Validity

### Surveys 
* Construct Validity
* Conclusion Validity
* Internal Validity

### Litterature Studies 
* Repeatable Methodology 
* Limitations
* Biases
