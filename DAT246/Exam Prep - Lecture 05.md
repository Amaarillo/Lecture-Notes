# Goal, Research Question, Hypothesis, and Evaluating an Article
When we want to conduct research we need funding, i.e. money. THis is to be able to affort potental expensive experiments and salaries for the researchers. But to get funding we need to convince the people of power to give us money. 

We need to define the purpose for our research, i.e. why we are doing it. 

A common approach for writing a purpose statement is the GQM metric. We set a standard set of company goals, such as business and cooporation goals. Then we generate questions that successfully describe those goals in the best possible fashion. Then we specify measures needed to answer questions. collect validate etc and try to meet the goals.

We also need a research question to meet our purpose and validate our work. Either we use the research question or we formulate a hypothesis. 

It is very important to review the research papers so that research remains of high quality. We can do this indirectly = check if researfh have been peer reviewed, or directly = read the paper
