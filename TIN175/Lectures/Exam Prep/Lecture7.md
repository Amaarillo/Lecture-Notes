# Stochastic Games 
Some games may have imperfect information, i.e. we do not know all the states. The idea here is to apply the mini-max function and choose the deal with the highest approximated value of all deals.  To view these we introduce "chance" nodes to our graphs, that ususally comes directly after the regular nodes, instead of calculating the min/max values we calculate the value with the highest/lowest expected value.
