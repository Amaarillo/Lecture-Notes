# What is AI?
AI stands for arteficial intellegence, that is, "smart" computers or machine. AI can be split into two sub-categories. 

## Strong AI
Strong AI means computers actually thinking

## Weak AI
Computers 'acting' intelligent. 

WHat is true AI, well the question is not really relevant, at least to scientists. 

An *AI System* can be in multiple configurations. It either
* Think Like a human
* Acts Like a human 
* Think rationally
* Acts rationally

# AI has a long standing history, and can be split into three "waves"
* Wave One AI is programmed behaviour, a computer bahaves according to the specification of a programmer
* Wave Two AI statistical AI, bases on data to create a model which is then used, I.e. statistical learning
* Wave Three is a combination of the two. Contextual Adaptation

# An agent is something that does something, i.e. senses the world via sensors and interacts with it using actuators.
We can measure the performance of an agent using a performance measure. I.e. how well do it perform it's intended behaviour in the current context. A rational egent takes action thet maximizes the performance measure. 

# Task enviroment
For an agent we need to specify the task enviroment, the PEAS

* Performance Measure
* Enviroment
* Actuators
* Sensors
Kinda self explanatory.

## The enviroment can be the following
* Observable: Fully/Partially
* Deterministic: deterministic vs stochastic
* Episodic: Episodic vs sequential
* Static: Static vs Dynamic
* Discrete: discrete vs continous
* Number of agents: Single/Multiple

# Solution
THe solution to an AI problem might be a bit confusing, it is usually characterized to being either optimal, satisficing, approximately optimal or probable, depending on our knowledge of the problem domain.

# Philosophy
Is Ai possible? 
The opinions differ. Some believe so, some do not.
