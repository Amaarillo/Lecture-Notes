This will not be on the exam, however, it will be on the project. 

## Natural Language
A language that develops naturally through use and repetition. And is used by humans,

## Formal Lanugage
A language constructed for some purpose, for example JavaScript, it is precisely defined. If stated incorrectly one can get errors, whereas natural language may still be understandable, for example . 

### NAtural Language Processing
Processing a natural language can be used in a multitude of ways, for example information retrieval such as responding to a question and machine translation, i.e. translating a natural language to another one.

### Approaches
Up untill 20 years ago, most NLP were rule based, i.e. gen 1 AI. Today voice recognition dialog systems use both rules and statistical NLP. 

## Phase structure Grammas
We here use the knowledge that words have different lexical categories, and so we can combine these into phrasal categories, grammar is a set of rules that describes the possible combinations. If we understand this we can break down a sentance into parts and process these. 

## Context free grammar
A context free grammar is a 4-tuple. That contains 4 parts, we can break these down to interpret a set of machine instructions.

## Syntactic analysis
Understanding this input is called parsing, there are a bunch of algorithms for these.

## Ambiguity
SOme sentances may be amimbigous forcing us to parse several parts of the sentance more than once

# Semantics
The following step once a sentance have been parsed, we need to interpret this. This can be done with semantics. Either via a statistical or logical approach. 

The semantics in the Shrdlite project consists of that one object corresponds to exacrly one name, one predicate for every relation, and a logical disjunction and conjunctions.
