# Designing an Architecture
---
Designing an architecture can be a challegin task, having a structured approach to this may make this task a bit easier. 

# Decomposition
Decomposition copnsists of breaking down the overall system into smaller sections. If such the quality attributes can also be broken down, making them easier to handle. It is easy to break down the system and focus on the architectural significant requirements. We can either focus on designing for all of them at the same time or only one at a time, the latter may be simpler for architects with lesser experience. One approach too this my be generate and test. We select a design decition as a hypothesis and check if it fulfills the requirements, if not we generate another hypothesis that builds on the errors of the first one. the hypothesises can be based on previous examples, frameworks, patterns, domain decomposition, and design checklists.

On example of this is ADD (attribute driven design)
This is a structured way of designing an architecture. It is an iterative process that each iteration helps the architect choose a part of the system, mangge the ASArs for that part and generate and test a design. 

Inputs to ADD are the requirements and the boundaries of the system as well as external entities.

ADD generates a set of skeches for design decitions for the system.
