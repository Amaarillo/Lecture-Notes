## Documenting Software Architectures
---
An architectural view gives a view so that stakeholders can verify the different functions/features they want from the system, the developers to understand what they want and so forth. Ususally we use the 4+1 or uml methodology to describe this. 

# The 4+1 view are a predecessor of  UML and breaks down the architectural view into four specific parts, UML can be directly correlated to this. 

## Logical(Structure) View: 
This view is regarding end user functionality and corresponds to; Class, Object and Component- diagram. 

## Behaviour(process) view;
THis touches  the performance of the system and corresponds to; Use-case State-chart, Sequence and activity diagrams. 

## Deployment View; 
This corresponds to the physical representation of the system i use and gives: Deployment Diagram

## Development View:
This is usable for the programmers and corresponds to; Use casse, sequence and activity diagram.
