# Architecture & Requirements
---
Requirements are a necessity for architecture design, to do this efficiently one also need ASAs, architecturarl significant requirments. One good place to look for these are in the documentation. Sniffing out ASAs here can be done by a designer, however, one should not wait untill the documentation/requirements are fully finished but start while they are in flux. 

# Design Decitions
Appying the previously mentioned design decitions to this we get the following; 

## Allocation of Responsibility
Planned evaluation of responsibilities, user roles, major processing steps etc

## Coordination Model
Coordination properties such as concurrency, names of external entities etc

## Data Model
Processing steps, major domain, information flows etc. 


## Management Of Resources 
Time, concurrency, memory steps, scheduling etc

## Mapping amongst architectural elements
Plans for teaming, processors, network configs etc

## Binding time decitions
Extention of flexibility of functionality

## Choice of Technology
Named technologies


# Getting ASAs by interviewing stakeholders 
Stakeholdes often have no idea of the ASAs, interviewing them and analyzing their responses can however help in eliciting these. 

# Getting ASAs from business goals
Busingess goals can help in eliciting the ASAs as these descibe how the software is supposed to generate revenue. PALM is a way of eliciting requirements from THe business goals. 

# Capturing ASAs from a utilite tree
The utility tree can give a good approximation for ASAs. THis consists of the different quality attribute requrimenets and their respective business and effect on architecture.
