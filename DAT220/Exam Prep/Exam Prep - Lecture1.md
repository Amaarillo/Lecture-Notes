## Introduction 
---
The size of software in some applications are ever increasing. For example, a modern car may contain 100 MLOC which is about the same as the ISS. Software architecture as such becomes ever more so important. 

Software architecture helps by defining a model of a system that is manageble, shows responsibilities of involved parties, gives a easy way of validating requirements etc. 

it also captures early design decitions, manages communication between stakeholders enables more costs and schedual estimations, etc. It as such have much value.

## Architects
The software architects are responsible for creating the software architecture. They must understand system priorities, make trade off decicions, manage politics etc.

## Layers
Software architecture have different layers

### Business layer: business constraints 

### Functional Layer: What functions are in the application

### Application Layer: More detailed

### Technical Layer: Low level technical aspects


## Drivers
Software architecture is driven by functional needs, quality needs and design constraints such as development process and business constraints.

## Key architectural elements
KAE are important to the architecture. Topics related to this are; Component Based Software Engineering which decomposes the system into logical components with high cohesion, connected by interfaces
