# Lecture 10
## Architecture analysis and evaluation 
---
Software architecture evaluation is about determining whether a software architecture is fit for its' purpose. I.e fulfills its requirements.

# Evaluating Quality Attributes
There are some different approaches to evaluating the quality attributes. 
* Scenario Based Evaluation Evaluate given scenarios.
* SimulationPrototype a section of architecture and test in product mode simulation
* Mathematical modeling: Math
* Experience based evaluation: Base on architects own experience

# Evaluation party
Evaluatiom can be done by the designer, a peer review group or external parties. The internal people might be biased thus it is nice to have outside perspectives

Evaluation can be done early in the design phase or later once the architecture is beginning to become done or within each iteration/between phases. 

## Why Though? 
Software architecture evaluation gives an indication of where the architecture might be of risk for failure so that it can be corrected. Further it has the benefits of getting all stakeholders in the same room, gives prioritizations, articulates quality goals and ultimately makes for a better architecture. However, it is not without its challenges.
