## Tactics and design principles 
---
Software projects usually have one or several stakeholders interested in the project. These might not be the best in the technical knowledge department, as such, tactics to elicit requirements are very important. As such, the role of the architect is to set priorities and make trade-off decitions for the system. Create a system abstraction that is correct and complete. Architects should have a toolbox full of design principles, patterns, tacits and reference architectures. 

# Principles
Some of the principles one can follow is: 
* Information Hiding: Hide what is not nessecary
* Low coupling: Low dependency betweeen modules so they can be changed without causing the end of the world. 
* High Cohesion: Modules should be logical collection of functionality. 
* Separation of concerns
* Keep it simple

# Tactics
Tactics are design decitions that influences the easiness of reaching a quality attribute. 

# Design Tactics/ decitions
Design decitions are a way of making sure that the quality attributes are uphold in the system, and in a sensa are allocation of responsibilites. 
* Allocation of Responsibilites: Allocates the responsibilities to the relevant parties,
* Data model: Choose the main data abstractions
* Management of Resources: Choose resources that must be managed, how the resources are shared etc.
* Mapping among architectural elements: assign elements by demads to available processing powers.
* Binding time desicisions: Adding stuff in runtime
* Choice of technology
*
