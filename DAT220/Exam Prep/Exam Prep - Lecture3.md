Requirements can often be split into two different categories, functional and quality requirements. Quality requirements are related to how well the system is to handle it's own functional requirements. The quality requirements/attributes determines the functionality of the system and in an extension, the architecture of the system. 

As software architect you should be able to elicit the relevant quality requirments. It is almost impossible to maximize all the QA, so tradeoffs needs to be made.
