# Performance
---
Performance is about how fast the system can perform' it's duties. IN performance, messages/events arrive either, periodically, stochastic, sporadic, with a latency

## Tactics
There exist some tactics to increase performance. These include 
* Managin the resources, such as limiting and blocking resource utalization for components for some times. 

Design tactics that follows this are; 

* Allocation of responsibilities : Decide what components are under heavy load and give them extra resources
* Coordination Model: Determine what resources should cooperate and choose communication protocols for these. 

* Data model: Determine what data will be under heavy load

* Mapping among architectural elements: Ensure that components with heavy computation requirements are assigned to the processors with the most capabilities. 

* Resource Management: Determine what resources in the system are critical for performance and ensure that these will be monitored under normal and overloaded system operation 

* Binding Time: Determine the overhead and nessecary time to complete the binding.

* Choice of technology: Chose based on performance need, for example for server technology etc.
