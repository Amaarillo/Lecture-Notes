# Archtectural Patterns
--- 
An architecural Pattern establishes a relationship between a context, a problem and a solution. 

The pattern contains a set of element types, topological layout of the components and a set of semantic constrainst covering topology. 

The catalog of patterns are extensive and include: 

# Patters
## Layered 
Separate the concerns into different layers responsible for some task. 

### Broker
Insert an intermediary between the server and client that handles the communication to the server interface 

### Model View Controller
Separate these three


### Pipe and filter
Data goes through the filers via the pipe and is cleaned up in every filter. 

### Client-Server
Client speaks to servers

### Peer-to-Peer
All clieants are both clients and server, split server behaviour. 


### Service-Oriented-Architecture
Speak to a service which has an architecture

### Publish-Subscribe

### Shared Data
All clients share the data 

### map-reduce


Patterns comprise the tactics
