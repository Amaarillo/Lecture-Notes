## Performance Evaluation 
---
Building on architecture evaluation we also might want to do some performance evaluation to make sure our system is at par with speed requirements. Thus we wish to do performance testing. This can be done by a variety of different ways. These include: 

* Load Testing
* Stress Testing
* Soak/Endurance Testing
* Spike Testing
* Configuration Testing
* Volume

Performance testing of often done by simulating transactions via a load generator withing some sort of enviroment,And then sending in nodes to probe the enviroment. These probe have a different goal, which is one of the above stratergies. The load generator gets some tasks it's supposed to accomplish.
