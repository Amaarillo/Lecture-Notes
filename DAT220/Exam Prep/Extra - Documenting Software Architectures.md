# Documenting Software Architectures
---
Documentation is crucial to facilitate future developments of the architecture and to make the stakeholders and people involved aware of the design such that they can argument for the architecture. Architecture can be split into three distinct categories. 
## INformal Notations
For example powerpoints, they are structure to be informal and thus not able to be formally analyzable. 
## Semiformal Notations
The views are described in a standardize format such as UML but does not give a complete semantic description of the views, can be rudimentally analyzed
## Formal Notations
Views are described in a fully formal format, for example math and thus can be fully analyzed. 


A view is a description of the analysis in a graphical way, based on the software tactice used. For example a layer in the layered design. 

A module is a set of classes/ enteties that have a specific responsibility.
