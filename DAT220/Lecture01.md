# What is this course?
To understand the values of software archetectures and it's role in Software Engineering process. 
# Size of software today
The size of software varies depending on it's enviroment. For example, an airbus A380 contains about 100MLOC. MOst cars today have more LOC than passenger airplanes.

## Complexity of software over time


## Distributed System with Distributed Development 
The drawbacks of this is that you need to keep track on what is doing what and when to reduce errors.
# How can software archetecture help?
Defines a model of a system that is manageble, it is easier to "visualize" a software archetecture when you have a model. Shows the responsibilites involved in development, etc

## Definition
There are several different definitions of archetecture. The one that the lecturer use is that archetecture consists of a set of "design decisions" that determine quality properties of a system. 

## Importance of Software archetecture
Software archetecture is very important to structure projects well. Look at slides for a list of important things.

# Stakeholders
Stakeholders have interests in the system, their concerns may be conflicting and thus these needs to be managed. 

# Tasks of archetects
Understand the ssytem, and make trade off decisiton etc.



## Layers of archetecture
* Business Processes (workflow)
* Functional Layer (services)
* Application Layer (structure of components/applications)
* Technical Layer (Infrastructure, HW, OS, Middleware)

## What drives Software archetecture? 
* Functional Needs: 
* Quality needs: 
* Design Constraints
