Taking the vasa ship into conisderation, this was a failure in architectural design, it is the job of the architects to make decitions, tradeoffs etc for the requested product. 



## Tools
Software Architects have a toolbox of distilled knowledge which they need to use when eliciting the software archetecture. 

## Principles 
*Information hiding* means hiding important code from the external world.
*Coupling* low dependancy betweem modules. 
* COhesion* Smaller cohesion means smaller interdependency between classes in the modules
*KIS* Keeping architectures simple is harder but better.
