# Software architecture evaluation. 
When evaluating a software architecture we check whether the current design satisfies the requirements of the software. That it won't lead to disaster etc. 

## What to evaluate? 
We want to evaluate how well the quality attributes are fulfilled.

# How to evaluate
One example is to check how well a quaity attribute is uphold in the architecture by asking a architect to explain how the quality attribute is fulfilled in the current architecture. Or by doing simulation, or by using mathematical modeling. Or by basing this on experience 

Evaluation can be done by the designer as he/she knows the most about the system. Or by a peer review. Or by an outsider which may be an expert. The evaluation should be made early, as architectural decitions may be difficult to change. 

## Benefits 
THe benefits of performing an evaluation is that you know whether it fulfills the quality requirements. Which of several candidates is the best. Puts stakeholders in same room, results in prioritization for quality goals, improves documentation etc. 

## Challenges
What artefacts are available, what resources are availavble, who performs the evaluation, what are the business goals etc. 

# ATAM
ATAM is a scenario based method in which we take our scenarios (quality attributes etc, non functional requirements), we bring people from outside and asses our architecture. A large set of stakeholders are involved. We can also here use a utility tree to. 

## ATAM activities
Atam can be split into several activities. The first one is requirement/scenario gathering, the second architectural decisions & views, third one is an analysis
