Architectural views are the system broken down into different aspects of the system, for presentation for stakeholders, examples include, class diagram, sequence diagrams etc. 

# 4+1 model views, the system can be broken down into logical views, these are; 

* Logical (Structure) view: Class Diagram, Object Diagram, Component Diagram, Context Diagram, we focus on component diagrams in this course
* Process (Behaviour) view: Sequence Diagram, Statechart Diagram, 
* Physical (Deployment) view: Context Diagram, Deployment Diagram (can also be a physical component diagram)
* Development (implementation) view: 
* Scenarios

# Component DIagram.
Different Components of the system

# Deployment Diagram
Gives a topological view of the system, which components are allocated on which hardware. 

# Context diagram 
We don't ususally have actors, contains boundary components and how these interact with outside sources. 

# Use case diagrams. 
How actors are related to the different use cases that should be implemented.
