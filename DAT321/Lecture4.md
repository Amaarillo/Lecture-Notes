#### 2017-09-11

The main problem we have with quality Assurance is that customer want a high quality product, but that costs money. As such Software quality Assurance is how a company handles this tension. And how they balance the cost/quality conundrum.

IEEE and ISO9000 have their own definitions of quality Assurance.

Collecting metrics for assuring quality are very expensive, as such companies may be reluctant to collect these as the return of investments are very low.

A software quality assurence plan covers development testing and maintenence for the software, also covers management, documentation, SQA requirements, training etc..

There are a multitude of different parameters and measurments of quality one needs to consider when doing quality assurence on a large scale, for example. resource use, learnability etc.

There are some different source code standards. MISRA, hungarian and JAVA - notations

Testing in SQAP requires answering to several questions, for example how many test cases one need ands so forth, however, these questions might be hard to answer. One needs to remember that once a software
has been released it is tested again (in production).
