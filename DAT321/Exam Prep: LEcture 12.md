### Sustainability

---
Sustainability is a more important thing in SE than one is lead to believe. For example, such a simple task as googling produces lots of greenhouse gasses every year. Thus sustainability is crucial to maintain a good enviroment. UN defines sustainability as follows: 
> "Development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs

Sustainability in software means limiting the resource usage while at the same time ensuring the sustainability of natural systems and the enviroment. One example is to make algorithms as efficient as possible, otherwise they take more ccomputing power to run = more enviromental impact.


## GREENSOF
An example model for sustainability in SE is the GREENSOFT model. This is based on product lifecycles.
THe model means keeping a logbook which specifies in the different product stages, the goals, dicitions and evaluation of sustainability. Thus one can create a model for software sustainability containing various parameters that directly and indirectly contributes to sustainability.

## Greenability
One useful term is the greenability term, this specifies how "green" a software is. THat is, how well a software lasts over time. How much energy the software consumes. HAve several sub-characteristics: 
* Energy efficiency: THe degree of efficiency in resource usage while doing its purpose for a software
* Resource optimization: THe way the resources used are in an optimal manner
* Capacity Optimization: THe way the maximum limits is optimal
* Perdurability: The degree to which a software can be used over a long period of time. Modified adapt and so forth.

## Carbon Footprint
THis measure specifies how big a "footprint" of a product is, that is the amount of CO2 that the product produces in it's entire lifecycle, from aquisition to termination, and al the mining of raw materials etc. All the other gasses are converted and added into the total CO2 equivalent (CO2e). One can use this as a funcitonal unit, for example CO2e/Licence.
