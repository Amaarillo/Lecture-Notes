Today we gonna talk about the course, some principles, recap and shit.

### What is a good quaity product?
A lot of people think that subjective views, such as "expensive" are a good approximation on the quality of the product. However, since these are unmeasurable they may not be a good way to measure quality.

However, the first "cut" one should make to destinguish quality is to separate quality from fuctionality.
As such, one can measure how well the different functionality behaves.

A professional view on quality is that claims should be quantifiable and measurable. Examples:
 * specified requirements
 * professionable standards
 * user expectation

However, this is not quite enough...

From a customers perspective, quality can be viewed as "assurences that theit  expectation on the product will be met"

As such, a quality product could be measured by the degree to which a product
* Meets specified requirements
* Meets users or customers needs or expectations
(IEEE)

As such, in order to prove that a product one have developed is of good quality, one needs to be able to break down the product, show that all functionality behaves correctly and that the product meets the users expectations.

### Quality in software.

Narrow:
* Lack of bugs

Wide
* Product properties
* Customer satisfaction
* Design properties
* Process properties


Bugs are a unclear definition, *What are bugs?*

BUGS = {Failure&Errors&Defect(Fault)}

If we measure using the wide perspective, we can define quality as
  * whether the customer is satisfied
  * whether the process used to create the product is good. Good processes = Happy products!
  * If the design is satisfactory
  * If the properties are satisfactory

As such, process, customer satsifactory and the product itself determine whether good quality has been achieved.

### Frameworks for measuring quality
IRM's CUPRIMDA Models: Mostly customer satisfaction. Shows how various attributes are connected in quality
