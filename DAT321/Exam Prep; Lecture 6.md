# Process and Product QUality.

---
A good process does not equal good software. And a bad process does not necessarily produce bad software, but often. However, a good process can help in the creation of good software.
There are some different workflows developers can follow

* Waterfall Proccess: Well known, things are done in order
* Rational unified process(RUp): Quality Process with well defined phases, avctivities tasks etc.
* Team Software Process (TSP): Detailed process description for small teams.

There are however needs for processes for software companies in order to reduce the risk for the development of bad software.

In measuring process quality one can use CMMI.

## CMMI 
Capability Maturity Model I is a way to measure how good a software company is in its process, defines "goodness" in levels where the most basic one is ad hoc processes and the best one focuses on continous process improvement. Each level has a Key Process Area defining how advanced the provess is, thus higher Maturity level => Higher KPA, not vice versa.
Checking the CMMI level is done manually during assessments and has to be done by an authorized auditor. CMMI does NOT tell you how to improve your maturity but gives a set of guidelines on what should be achieved for each level.

One metric for process quality is the FST fault slip through.

Fault injection is a way of checking if injecting of faults, for example changing an operator results in the program terminating.
