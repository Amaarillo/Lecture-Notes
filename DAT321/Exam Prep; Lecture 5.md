### Measurment Theory

--- 
WE need measurment theory in order to quantify data in numbers, so that we can measure and evaluate various properties of software.

There are various models for the different design stages, for example, the process might have an efficiency or cost model,  The design migh have complexity and size, and the code might have performance.

Off the shelf metrics are usually not very good, solution: Have own metrics.

## Measurment theory: 
A theory on how we should measure, and what properties these measures shall have. 

MEasurments have different scales: 
* Nominal: Categories
* Ordinal: Good, better best 
* Ratio, height, difference between 8-10 is same as difference between 48-50
* Absolute: Things are assigned numbers, for example number of cars.

Various statistical analyses are onlys uitable for some of the scales, avg. is not suitable for nominal. For example, comparing between two nominal scales, a chi-squared analysis would be better.

### Validity
The extnet on which the method of measurment reflect the true meaning of the concept being investigated. This is split into subcategories
* External Validity: How well the variables represents the phenomena of interest.
* Internal Validity: How well the actual measurments reflect the variables
* Content Validity: Does the scale measure what it should measure? 
* Face Validity: Does the tools seem valid to the people using them
* Predictive Validity: Can the measure be used to make predictions
* Criterion Validity: Does a measure predict another criterion
* Constuct validity: Does the measure fit well with simular methods.

### Reliability
If the study can be conducted the same and yield the same results, it is reliable.

### Precision
Does the measurment give about the same value for each time used on the same thing. Small random error.

### Accuracy:
Does the measurment give about the same value as the real value.
