### Sustainability IN software Engineering
#### 2017-10-12
----------
Today we will talk about sustainability, this is rather new, but has grown widely in the later years. 
We will also go through the different steps for calcualating carbon footprint for software. 

We've seen already two systematic reviews for sustainability for software engineering.

Sustainability also have to do with people have a life, and people being able to have a life. 

## United nations definition of sustainable development
Basically, don't fuck with coming generations ability to fulfill their needs. 

Many people think that the IT industry needs to lead the path to a more sustainable way of life for the entire world. 

One example for measuring the sustainability for software is the GREENSOFT model. 

Thus, sustainability becomes a part of the quality of a software. 

Performance efficiency: Is the performance relative to the resources used, "it should use the resources it needs, but no more. For example, use correct algorithms. "

Greenability: When system is used we want to minimize enviromental effect. For example, amazon software being cheaper at night.

In swebok, Software Engineering is described, there's a chapter on quality.

## Carbon Footprint
When talking about carbon footprint, we do not only talk about carbon footprint, we take other gasses into account. IN ordere to be able to specify the carbon footprint we select a "Functional Unit", one exampkle is CO2e/PM which is the carbon dioxide equivalent of person month. Basically Co2e/something. 

One can determine how big the carbon footprint was during the development. So total during the development phase is Co2e/PM * PM to get the total carbon footprint. And also for the distribution phase. Most software is delivered electronically, but that also causes emmisisons. 

Every fault we find increase energy consumption. Requirements are good, the more time we spend in the requirement phase, one hour, might save us 4-5 hours in development, thus lowering energy consumption. Requirements are cool and energy saving. But boring as fuck.
